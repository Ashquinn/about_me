# About Me

This project will serve as the portfolio of all the work to come in this bootcamp. So far I satisfied with the layout and color scheme. The portfolio however is not yet complete and is a work in progress. I have several alterations that still need to be and to both the CSS and HTML files. But again I am pleased with what I have so far. The portfolio has an about me section, work section, and a contact me section. There is a link in the nav bar that will also reference my Resume once that it completed.
