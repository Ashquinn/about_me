# About Me

This project will serve as the portfolio of all the work to come in this bootcamp. The portfolio has an about me section, work section, and a contact me section. With in the work section you will find several projects in which I have either completed independently or within a group. Each project consist of a pair of links, one for the deployed site and the other to the source code. This portfolio shows the complete culmination of everything I have learned so far and will continue to grow and improve with each additional project I complete. There is a link in the nav bar that will also reference my Resume once that it completed.
